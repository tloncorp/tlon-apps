## Introduction
This document covers the scries, pokes, and subscriptions for Tlon's chat, notebook, and gallery channel backend.

### Agents
Tlon's channels are implemented through two agents, `%channels` and `%channels-server`. These both communicate with each other, and `%channels` also communicates with frontends and third-party agents.

`%channels-server` is intended for internal use by `%channels`. As such, we will not be elaborating on its API here.

`%channels`, on the other hand, is there precisely to facilitate use by frontend clients and third-party agents. Its API is made up primarily of two types:

Actions describe user actions, like creating a channel or sending a message. Actions types are prefixed with `$a-`.
Responses describe changes made to channels. Response types are prefixed with `$r-`

### Code examples
To use these code examples in the dojo, import the types with `=c -build-file /=groups=/sur/channel/hoon`

To use these code examples in an agent, replace any instance of`/=groups=` with `/(scot %p our.bowl)/groups/(scot %da now.bowl)` and import the types with `/-  c=channel`

You'll also need a group to put channels in. Use this code snippet in your dojo to create one:

```hoon
=g -build-file /=groups=/sur/groups/hoon

=create :*
  name=%mygroup
  title='My group'
  description='This is my group'
  image=''
  cover=''
  cordon=`cordon:g`[%open ban=[ships=~ ranks=~]]
  members=`(jug ship sect:g)`(~(put ju *(jug ship sect:g)) our %admin)
  secret=%.n
  ==

:groups &group-create create
```

A `%channel-denied` fact means you cannot view the channel. See [$said](https://github.com/tloncorp/tlon-apps/blob/develop/desk/sur/channels.hoon#L208)
