# TM Urbit guide 
TM backend software is deployed atop the [urbit](http://urbit.org) platform, a novel networked operating system. Urbit is still in many ways an experimental platform. It is being actively developed, and while many OS interfaces are relatively stable, the system is not without its quirks. 

This guide is meant to supplement the [official documentation](https://docs.urbit.org), casting light into darker corners of the system, but also to put urbit OS behavior in the practical context of the Tlon Messenger.
