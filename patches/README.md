# Patched Dependencies

This directory contains local dependency patches applied through
`pnpm.patchedDependencies` in the repo root `package.json`.

When adding a patch, document:
- why we need it locally
- the upstream issue or PR it came from
- how to validate it
- when it can be removed

## @gorhom/bottom-sheet@5.2.6

Why:
On the first open of a bottom sheet whose content is a `flex:1` ScrollView/View
with content larger than the eventual viewport (a long scrollable list with a
footer/submit button below it), the footer ends up positioned past the bottom
of the visible sheet. The first frame of `contentMaskContainerAnimatedStyle`
returns `{}` while the container height is still being measured, so the
flex:1 child is laid out at intrinsic content size; once the real height
arrives a frame later, Yoga keeps the stale flex-basis from the unconstrained
pass and the child overflows.

The patch returns `{ height: 0 }` on the initial frame so children never get
a chance to lay out at intrinsic size, then snaps the height directly
(without going through `withTiming`) on the first real layout pass to avoid
animating the height up from 0. Subsequent transitions use the normal
animated path.

This is a workaround for an underlying Yoga bug that affects any flex tree
with the same shape, not just gorhom — see facebook/yoga#1552. The proper RN
fix (enabling Yoga's `WebFlexBasis` flag) requires building React Native
from source, which we currently don't do; the writeup is in the closed
draft PR linked below.

Local patch:
`patches/@gorhom__bottom-sheet@5.2.6.patch`

Background and reproduction details: PR #5790 (closed, kept for reference).

Validation:
Open any sheet whose content is a `flex:1` `ScrollView` with content larger
than the viewport plus a footer (e.g. CreateChatSheet). The footer should be
visible at the bottom of the sheet on first open.

Removal:
Drop this patch once we either move to building React Native from source
(so we can flip the Yoga `WebFlexBasis` flag and fix the bug at the
layout-engine level), or once `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` ships an equivalent
workaround upstream.

## react-native-screens@4.4.0

Why:
iOS native-stack can double-pop when two back-swipe gestures happen in quick
succession, causing a brief `Channel -> GroupChannels -> ChatList ->
GroupChannels -> ChatList` bounce.

Local patch:
`patches/react-native-screens@4.4.0.patch`

Upstream:
- issue: `software-mansion/react-native-screens#2559`
- fix: `software-mansion/react-native-screens#3584`
- enabled by default: `software-mansion/react-native-screens#3652`

Validation:
Rebuild the iOS app and verify that fast successive swipe-backs no longer cause
the screen bounce.

Removal:
Remove this patch once we upgrade to a compatible `react-native-screens`
version that already includes the upstream fix. `4.24.0+` has the behavior
enabled by default.

## @10play/tentap-editor@0.5.21

Why:
- Strips the package's bundled `Images` export, which was causing import errors in prod
- Removes the web bundle's legacy HTML hyperlink paste fallback, which can
  crash the Firefox note editor when pasting rich hyperlinks and make existing
  text appear deleted.

Local patch:
`patches/@10play__tentap-editor@0.5.21.patch`

Upstream:
- TipTap removed the same HTML-anchor paste path in
  `ueberdosis/tiptap@e8cfe043b753ee2a26cc595e95fd5e6e901285bf`
- Later `@10play/tentap-editor` versions also appear to have dropped this
  behavior. As of upstream `1.0.1`, the package is on TipTap 3 and
  `src/bridges/link.ts` is just a thin wrapper around
  `@tiptap/extension-link`, without the old HTML `text/html` anchor fallback.

Validation:
- Build the editor package and verify the patch still applies cleanly.
- In Firefox, paste a rich hyperlink into notes and confirm the editor does not
  crash or reload.
- Confirm the app still builds in production without reintroducing the original
  `@10play/tentap-editor` import error.

Removal:
Remove this patch once we upgrade off the old `0.5.x` web bundle and confirm
the replacement no longer vendors the legacy HTML link paste fallback or needs
the local asset export stripping.
