# Tlon Messenger backend
The backend of the Tlon Messenger app is hosted on the Urbit platform.

All the backend code is located in the desk/ directory, which
is deployed to an urbit ship.

## Development
Interface with a running urbit ship through a tmux session
running an urbit ship. Do not switch to that session, but interface
with it using tmux input and capture commands.
A typical command to verify connection is working is `%`, which will
display current identity, desk and time.

## Backend tests

There are two kinds of backend tests in groups. The first kind uses the
`/lib/test-agent.hoon` library, which provides a monadic framework for
implementing gall agent tests. It works by simulating rudimentary gall
functionality, which allows testing of the agent core (which is a pure function of
agent state) under the variety of circumstances.

test-agent tests are located in `/tests` directory, under the
corresponding desk entry. For example, tests for `/app/groups.hoon`
agent would be located at `/tests/app/groups.hoon`.

The second kind of tests uses aqua-based ship virtualization.
Using aqua, a virtual fleet of ships can be run directly on a 
ship with little resource cost. While these ships are not
fully-featured and do not support every urbit runtime event, they
nonetheless allow testing of gall agents running on virtualized ship.

Aqua tests are located in `/tests/ph` directory.

For details on how to work with aqua tests see documentation in `/docs/aqua`
