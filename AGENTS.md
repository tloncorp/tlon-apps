# Tlon Messenger frontend
The TypeScript/React client is documented in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root.

Before reasoning about local database reads, caching, or whether a component
sees fresh data, read `docs/tlon-apps/db-react-query.md`. React Query here runs
with a global `staleTime: Infinity` and refreshes only through explicit
table-dependency invalidation, so its cache behavior does not match React Query
defaults and should not be inferred from memory.

# Tlon Messenger backend
The backend of the Tlon Messenger app is hosted on the Urbit platform.

All the backend code is located in the desk/ directory, which
is deployed to an urbit ship.

## Development
Interface with a running urbit ship through a tmux session
running an urbit ship. Do not switch to that session, but interface
with it using tmux input and capture commands.
A typical command to verify connection is working is `%`, which will
display current identity, desk and time.

## Backend documentation
Comprehensive backend documentation can be found in `/docs/backend`.
For system components, the directory structure mirrors that of a desk
and is located under `/docs/backend/desk`.
The documentation on the groups agent would thus be found at
`/docs/backend/desk/app/groups.md`.

Always be sure to read documentation before answering any queries
relevant to the backend or to backend tests.

## Backend tests
There are two kinds of backend tests in groups. The first kind uses the
`/lib/test-agent.hoon` library, which provides a monadic framework for
implementing gall agent tests. It works by simulating rudimentary gall
functionality, which allows testing of the agent core (which is a pure function of
agent state) under the variety of circumstances.

test-agent tests are located in `/tests` directory, under the
corresponding desk entry. For example, tests for `/app/groups.hoon`
agent would be located at `/tests/app/groups.hoon`.

The second kind of tests uses aqua-based ship virtualization.
Using aqua, a virtual fleet of ships can be run directly on a 
ship with little resource cost. While these ships are not
fully-featured and do not support every urbit runtime event, they
nonetheless allow testing of gall agents running on virtualized ship.

Aqua tests are located in `/tests/ph` in the desk directory.

For details on how to work with aqua tests see documentation in
`/docs/backend/aqua`.

## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_backlog_instructions()` to load the tool-oriented overview. Use the `instruction` selector when you need `task-creation`, `task-execution`, or `task-finalization`.

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and finalization
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
