This cohort will ran twice a week until November 1. Requires about 4 hours/week including homework. Beginners are welcome.\0a\0aIf you\'re a developer curious about building on Urbit, I really think you should start learning now.\0a\0aWhen [Uqbar](https://uqbar.network) goes to mainnet within the next year, the ability to write smart contracts in Hoon could become one of the highest-paid skills in the world (supply right now is relatively very low).\0a\0aUrbit will be the only place in the world where you can build arbitary, user-facing computer programs with unlimited financial programmability.\0a\0aHoon School right now is a no-brainer for any skilled crypto-dev looking for the next massively asymmetric opportunity.\0a\0aTo join Hoon School starting tonight, just [drop your email here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdR6vRmlpYMFe40n_14ITq2ZkxxQkkULINjeeHB2x9UgN72lw/viewform)\0a\0a---\0a\0a## This Is What a Cambrian Explosion Looks Like (Urbit Assembly Recap)\0a\0aWe\'re very bad at noticing exponential growth in its early stages.\0a\0aLook at any exponential or "hockey-stick" growth curve and you\'ll see that, at the very beginning, it looks flat for a while.\0a\0aIn May of 2021, I argued that Urbit looked like [the long-ran telos of the creator economy](https://www.otherlife.co/urbit/). At that time, there were no apps on Urbit, just chat rooms. There were no startups building on Urbit.\0a\0aIn October 2021, at Urbit\'s first national conference (Assembly 1), app distribution became possible for the first time.\0a\0aOne year after this, there are now somewhere between 50 and 70 apps you can download today.\0a\0aThere are now 3 well-funded startups, plus Tlon, building serious technologies on Urbit. Each one presented jaw-dropping progress, in less than one year after app distribution arrived.\0a\0aFor comparison, consider Consensys, the incubator of Ethereum-based products. Many Consensys-funded companies would take [1-2 years before shipping any kind of prototype at all.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2018/12/05/cryptopia-in-crisis-billionaire-joe-lubins-ethereum-experiment-is-a-mess-how-long-will-he-prop-it-up/?sh=3c2690242f0a)\0a\0a- The Holium company showcased an Urbit desktop app that lets individuals send and receive crypto within the Direct Messaging panel, and allows members of a community to blend their computers together over any app. Multiple cursors on anything you want. "Figma but for everything."\0a\0a- Uqbar shipped a public testnet for their Urbit-native ETH L2. You can now write smart contracts manipulating money and Urbit applications at once.\0a\0a- Tlon shipped a complete overhaul of the longest-ranning and most widely used community interface (Groups), plus an iOS app for DMs; everything is nicer and much faster.\0a\0a- Tirrel previewed their own desktop app and showcased a new system for executing fiat payments from your personal Urbit server. I had a conflict during their presentation but I\'m told that planet sales from within %Studio newsletters (like this one) are also coming soon.\0a\0a[Screenshots and short demo videos here.](https://twitter.com/jmrphy/status/1574792513080082433)\0a\0aI hate to sound like a stupid bulltard, I just think that _this is what a Cambrian Explosion looks like_ (at the beginning).\0a\0a50-70 apps in the first year, including a blockchain with an integrated developer environment that makes smart contract development faster and more fun than anywhere else in crypto? I\'m sorry but, I just really feel like it\'s game over already and I\'m trying to figure out why more people don\'t agree (yet).\0a\0aJust look at the reality of the past 3 years. Urbit is [in takeoff.](https://hatryx-lastud.tlon.network/newsletter/urbit-takeoff-is-here)\0a\0aIt\'s hard for me to think of events that could prevent Urbit from becoming the preeminent social execution layer for all of crypto. I think I just coined that phrase by the way: Social, as in where humans live and do things together, and execution layer as in the execution of off-chain and on-chain computation in one seamlessly programmable space.\0a\0a---\0a\0a## How to Invest in Urbit\0a\0aI\'m often asked by individuals and institutions how they can get exposure to the Urbit network. So I published a page just to share everything I\'ve learned brokering some deals in the past. Disclaimer: I\'m extremely biased, duh.\0a\0a[A guide to investing in stars, galaxies, and new companies on Urbit.](https://www.otherlife.co/investing-in-urbit/)\0a\0a---\0a\0a## Political Thermodynamics\0a\0a> "Another concept we can draw from thermodynamics is the concept of an engine. An engine uses a system moving from a low entropy to higher entropy state to do useful work. I believe the same thing can apply to politics where a group can use the entropy strategy to gain power and then expend that power on definite, entropy defying aims."\0a\0aBy `~bintus-ragret`.

If they like Urbit, they can buy a ship whenever they want.\0a\0aThere are a few caveats.\0a\0aYour moon people should know that their moon is not sovereign like a planet is (the sponsor can turn off moons). Your planet needs to have 24/7 uptime (i.e., cloud hosting), or else your moon people will be locked off the network when your planet is off. Also, moons may be able to affect your planet in certain ways (or so I\'m told; I don\'t understand why or how exactly), so be careful about that.\0a\0aInstall %Houston by searching for `~nodmyn-dosrux` in the Grid or in Terminal enter `|install ~nodmyn-dosrux %houston`.\0a\0a---\0a\0a## Help Build the Next Internet\0a\0aCompanies building Urbit are hiring for the following positions. \0a\0aTechnical:\0a\0a- iOS / Swift Developer\0a- Experienced Hoon engineer\0a- React / Electron Developer\0a- Full-Stack Developer (hosting)\0a\0aLess technical:\0a\0a- Inbound Sales / Customer Success\0a- Principal Product Designer\0a- Release Manager / Dev Experience\0a- Director of Finance\0a\0aIf any of these sound like you, hit reply to this email (or DM me) and I\'ll connect you to the right person.\0a\0a---\0a\0a## So...
