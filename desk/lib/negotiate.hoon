::  negotiate: hands-off version negotiation
::
::      v1.0.1: greenhorn ambassador
::
::    automates negotiating poke & watch interface versions, letting the
::    underlying agent focus on talking to the outside world instead of
::    figuring out whether it can.
::
::      usage
::
::    to use this library, you must supply it with three things:
::    - a flag specifying whether the inner agent should be notified of version
::      negotiation events (matching & unmatching of external agents)
::    - a map of, per protocol your agent exposes, a version noun
::    - a map of, per agent name, a map of, per protocol, the version we expect
::    call this library's +agent arm with those three arguments, and then call
::    the resulting gate with your agent's door.
::
::    this library will "capture" watches, leaves and pokes emitted by the
::    underlying agent.
::    watches will be registered as intent to subscribe. leaves rescind that
::    intent. when first attempting to open a subscription to another agent (a
::    specific $gill:gall), the library will start version negotiation with
::    that agent for each protocol configured for it. only once it has heard a
::    matching version from the remote agent for *all* protocols will the
::    library establish the subscriptions for which intent has been signalled.
::    if it hears a changed, non-matching version from a remote agent, it will
::    automatically close the subscriptions to that agent (and re-open them
::    whenever versions match again).
::    sending pokes will crash the agent if no version match has been
::    established. to avoid crashing when trying to send pokes, the inner agent
::    must take care to call +can-poke or +read-status to check, and +initiate
::    to explicitly initiate version negotiation if necessary.
::    once the library start negotiating versions with another agent, it never
::    stops listening to their versions.
::
::    subsequent changes to the arguments given to this library will result in
::    similar subscription management behavior: we temporarily close
::    subscriptions for agents we have version mismatches with, and open ones
::    where we now do have matching versions. in upgrade scenarios, changing
::    the library arguments should generally suffice.
::
::    if the flag at the start of the sample is set to true then, whenever we
::    start to match or stop matching with a specific gill, we send a poke to
::    the inner agent, marked %negotiate-notification, containing both a flag
::    indicating whether we now match, and the gill for which the notification
::    applies.
::    (the initial state, of not having negotiated at all, counts as "not
::    matching".)
::
::    regardless of the value of the notify flag, subscription updates about
::    version compatibility will always be given on the following paths:
::    /~/negotiate/notify       %negotiate-notifcation; [match=? =gill:gall]
::    /~/negotiate/notify/json  %json; {'gill': '~ship/dude', 'match': true}
::
::    if an agent was previously using epic, it can trivially upgrade into
::    this library by making the following changes:
::    - change its own epic version number
::    - keep exposing that on the /epic subscription endpoint
::    - remove all other epic-related negotiation logic
::    - use this library as normal
