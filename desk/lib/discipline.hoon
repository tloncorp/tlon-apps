::  discipline: enforce mark sanity
::
::    guards the inner agent's egress against mark shenanigans.
::    set it up by wrapping it around an agent, providing known marks and
::    their types, and specifying which subscription and scry paths are
::    allowed to produce which marks.
::    on agent reload, will check to ensure mark types have not changed.
::    whenever the agent emits facts, or gets scried into, will check that
::    the output lines up with what was specified, and if we know the relevant
::    mark types, that the data actually fits in those.
::
::    watch and scry paths may use the empty path element to indicate
::    "wildcard" spots where any value is matched. the first matching prefix
::    is used.
::REVIEW  or do we want to enforce "longest matching prefix"?
::    for subscription paths, specify any number of marks. zero marks means
::    anything goes. for scry paths, specify the mark that should be produced.
::    the empty string mark means anything goes, but is mostly intended for
::    stubbing out recognition of dev tooling scries.
::
::    mismatches are reported as priority debug prints and, when possible,
::    logged to posthog as criticals.
::
::    usage example:
::      /%  m-my-mark  %my-mark
::      %-  %-  discipline
