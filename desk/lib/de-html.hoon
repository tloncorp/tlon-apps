::  de-html: tolerant-ish html parser
::
::    modified from +de-xml:html on an as-needed basis.
::    don't rely on this to be able to parse any html page (yet).
::
::    expansions compared to +de-xml:html include broader support for:
::    - implicitly self-closing tags (like <br>)
::    - tags with plaintext bodies (like <script>)
::    - all html5 &entities;
::    - tag attributes without quotes
::    - whitespace in attributes
::    - counting CR as valid whitespace
::    - allowing stand-alone ampersands (in +escp)
::
::    purely for reference, consider the syntax spec and
::    related parts of the html living standard docs.
::    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html
::    we don't claim to be matching it tightly anywhere,
::    but may refer to it occasionally.

  ::NOTE  the order of this pose has been tuned to avoid degenerate cases.

  ::      we could spend the whole document looking for a closing tag that
  ::      never comes, only learning that fate when we reach eof.
  ::      trying "implicit self-closing" first has us maybe proceed under
  ::      a false assumption, but we learn that much earlier: as soon as we
  ::      encounter an unexpected close tag.
