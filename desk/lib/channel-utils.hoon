::  +uv-* functions convert posts, replies, and reacts into their "unversioned"
::  forms, suitable for responses to our subscribers.
::  +s-* functions convert those posts and replies into their "simple" forms,
::  suitable for responses to subscribers that use an older version of the api,
::  or just don't care about details like edit status.
::  +suv-* functions do both, sequentially.
